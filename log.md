# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 9, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Updated project README files. Attempt to fix our COVID-19 map, which is broken at the moment. 

**Thoughts:** After work, I collaborated with David Metcalf on fixing an API error on a COVID-19 tracker application. This was the first project we built for our Bootcamp. The map is currently broken because the old API call has been blocked by the creator. Over the weekend we plan to update the original API call to work correctly with the new object data. I'm excited to start this new challenge and for what's to come!

### Day 2: October 10, 2020 

Day 2: #100daysofcode Started learning #Python! Today I learned about scripting, creating variables, and how to generate inputs & outputs. I highly recommend giving it a go! Treehouse is a fantastic resource to learn how to code.
