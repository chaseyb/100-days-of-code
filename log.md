# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 9, 2020 
After work, I collaborated with David Metcalf on fixing an API error on a COVID-19 tracker application. This was the first project we built for our Bootcamp. The map is currently broken because the old API call has been blocked by the creator. Over the weekend we plan to update the original API call to work correctly with the new object data. I'm excited to start this new challenge and for what's to come!

### Day 2: October 10, 2020 
Started learning #Python! Today I learned about scripting, creating variables, and how to generate inputs & outputs. I highly recommend giving it a go! Treehouse is a fantastic resource to learn how to code.

### Day 3: October 11, 2020 
Continued to learn more about #Python! Tomorrow, I plan on building a simple game to show the skills I've learned. 

### Day 4: October 12, 2020 
Started to build a snake game using #Python! I plan on finishing the game tomorrow once I have a better understanding of PyGame. It's a set of Python modules designed for writing simple video games.

### Day 5: October 13, 2020 

Finished building my snake game using #Python but it doesn't work. Unfortunately, PyGame is not able to run with the latest version of Python 3.9 on my Mac. I will attempt to fix the issue tomorrow. Even though I wasn't able to get it working I'm excited to learn more about Python!

### Day 6: October 14, 2020 
Finally got my Snake game to work! There was an issue running the Script.py file with the terminal. Feel free to check out the game. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

### Day 7: October 15, 2020 
Practiced coding String Methods, Booleans, and If Else & Elif statements in #Python. This weekend I plan on adding more functionality to the Snake game I recently created.


### Day 8: October 16, 2020
Made minor improvements to V1 of my snake game. I started working on a newer version which I hope to have finished by the weekend.

My goals for V2 are:
- Game Over Screen
- High score (Logged in a text window)
- Scaling difficulty (Snake gets faster as it grows)
- Use images for Snake & Food
- Improve syntax and cleaner code

### Day 9 & 10: October 18, 2020
Continued to work on V2 of my Snake game. I figured out how to log high scores using Pickle. Still playing around with FPS and clock speed that scales when a user eats an apple.

### Day 11 & 12: October 20, 2020 
Finished version two of my Python Snake game! Biggest improvements with V2:

- High scores save to local storage using Pickle
- Scaleable FPS that increases when the user gets points 
- Created a golden apple for additional points 
- Created loading/game over screens
- Established boundary with collision detection

### Day 13: October 27, 2020
Took a break from the screen to enjoy the outdoors. Today, I continued my learning journey with Python and completed a coding challenge on Treehouse. Taking regular breaks not only helps you maintain a healthy body, but it also increases your productivity significantly.

### Day 14: November 3, 2020
Built a command-line application that allows users to purchase tickets for upcoming events. This app was built with Python and takes the input from a user to generate a ticket sale. Out of all the languages I've learned so far, Python has been the most enjoyable!
